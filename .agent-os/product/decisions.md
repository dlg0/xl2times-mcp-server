## 2025-07-29: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Team

### Decision

Build an MCP server for xl2times that enables LLM agents to interact with VEDA-TIMES energy system models. The product will expose xl2times functionality through the Model Context Protocol and include an integrated GAMS API server for model execution. Target users are energy system researchers and AI/LLM application developers working on decarbonization pathways.

### Context

The current VEDA-TIMES workflow is manual and time-consuming, requiring researchers to process Excel files, validate syntax, and run GAMS models through disconnected tools. There's a growing need to integrate energy system modeling with AI agents for automated research workflows. This product addresses that gap by providing the first MCP-native interface for energy modeling.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Standalone CLI wrapper without MCP**
   - Pros: Simpler implementation, direct CLI access
   - Cons: No LLM integration, limited automation potential

2. **REST API without MCP**
   - Pros: Standard web integration, language agnostic
   - Cons: Not optimized for LLM interaction, requires custom integration

3. **Separate xl2times and GAMS tools**
   - Pros: Modular design, independent development
   - Cons: Fragmented user experience, complex integration

### Rationale

MCP provides the ideal protocol for LLM-tool interaction, and combining xl2times functionality with GAMS execution creates a seamless workflow. Using Python with uv package management aligns with the xl2times ecosystem while enabling easy distribution via uvx.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- First-to-market MCP solution for energy modeling
- Unified workflow from Excel to GAMS results
- Enables AI-powered energy research automation
- Easy installation and distribution via uvx

**Negative:**
- Complexity of maintaining two services (MCP and GAMS API)
- Dependency on external GAMS solver licensing
- Learning curve for MCP protocol adoption

## 2025-07-29: Architecture Decision - Combined Repository

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

Implement both the MCP server and GAMS API server in the same repository and project, with clear module separation.

### Context

While the MCP server and GAMS API are conceptually different services, they share common dependencies, configuration, and need tight integration for the end-to-end workflow. Keeping them together simplifies development, testing, and deployment.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Separate repositories**
   - Pros: Clear separation of concerns, independent versioning
   - Cons: Complex integration testing, duplicate configuration, harder deployment

### Rationale

A monorepo approach with clear module boundaries provides the best balance of maintainability and integration. Both services can share logging, configuration, and utility code while remaining logically separated.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Simplified development workflow
- Easier integration testing
- Shared configuration and utilities
- Single deployment package

**Negative:**
- Larger codebase in single repository
- Need careful module separation
- Potential for unwanted coupling
