## Overview

Implement a functional MCP server that exposes xl2times CLI capabilities to LLM agents through the Model Context Protocol. This foundational phase establishes the core server infrastructure and command wrapper system for VEDA-TIMES model processing.

## User Stories

### XL2TIMES Command Execution

As an Energy System Modeler, I want to execute xl2times commands through an MCP interface, so that I can automate VEDA-TIMES model conversion and validation workflows.

The modeler connects their LLM agent to the MCP server and issues commands like "convert my VEDA model to GAMS format" or "validate the syntax of my TIMES tables". The server processes these requests by wrapping the xl2times CLI, handling file operations, and returning structured results that the LLM can interpret and act upon.

### Automated Error Diagnosis

As an AI Research Engineer, I want to receive structured error reports from xl2times operations, so that my LLM agents can understand and respond to validation issues automatically.

When the engineer's agent submits a VEDA-TIMES model with syntax errors, the MCP server catches the xl2times validation output, parses it into a structured format, and returns detailed error information including file locations, table names, and specific issues. This enables the LLM to suggest fixes or take corrective actions.

## Spec Scope

1. **MCP Server Foundation** - Set up the basic MCP server using python-sdk with proper protocol handling and request routing
2. **XL2TIMES Command Wrapper** - Create a comprehensive wrapper exposing all xl2times CLI commands (convert, validate, extract, etc.) through MCP
3. **File Management System** - Implement secure file handling for VEDA-TIMES Excel files and generated GAMS outputs
4. **Error Handling Framework** - Design structured error responses that provide LLM-friendly diagnostics and suggestions
5. **Configuration & Logging** - Set up environment-based configuration with python-dotenv and comprehensive logging with loguru

## Out of Scope

- GAMS API server implementation (Phase 2)
- Actual GAMS execution capabilities (Phase 2)
- VEDA table extraction features (Phase 3)
- Advanced validation beyond xl2times built-in capabilities (Phase 3)
- PyPI packaging and distribution (Phase 4)

## Expected Deliverable

1. A working MCP server that can be started locally and accepts connections from LLM agents
2. Full xl2times CLI functionality exposed through MCP protocol with proper request/response handling
3. Comprehensive error handling that transforms xl2times output into structured, actionable information for LLMs
